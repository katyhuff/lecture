\section{Solid Dissolution}

Dissolution occurs after some kind of alteration and degradation. 

Alteration is when some chemical reaction changes the characteristics  of a 
material. 

Give glass example.  

Show that there are physical dissolution models being generated. 

Waste form dissolution results may take place at a constant rate, a time 
dependent rate, or  a physical model dependent on both static and dynamic 
parameters such as temperature, water velocity, or pH. 

\subsection{Waste Package Failure}

Waste package failure is described best by a probability distribution such that 
a few packages can fail discretely at any one time. 

It's also possible that a good model would fail all of the waste packages 
fractionally at some rate. This will affect both the water going in and the 
water coming out, but it's not clear to me how much this will affect those 
things.
